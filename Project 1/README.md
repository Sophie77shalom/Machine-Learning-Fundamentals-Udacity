## Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

In this project, l will leverage the AutoGluon library to train multiple models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle. Using Tabular Prediction, I will fit data from provided CSV files to predict bike-sharing demand. This project showcases your ability to utilize AutoGluon for model training, optimization, and iterative improvement.

Key Steps
Data Preparation:

Load and preprocess the dataset provided by the competition.
Ensure data is clean and suitable for training, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training with AutoGluon:

Use AutoGluonâ€™s Tabular Prediction module to train multiple models.
Experiment with different configurations and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Automatically leverage ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy.
Evaluation and Submission:

Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
Select the best-performing models and submit predictions to the Kaggle competition.
Track your rank and performance on the Kaggle leaderboard.
Reporting:

Document your process, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
Share your findings in a comprehensive report, highlighting the models used, their performance, and insights gained.
Publish the report on Kaggle or your personal page to showcase your work.
