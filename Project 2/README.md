## Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

In this project, I will create a proof of concept for an optical character recognition (OCR) system using the MNIST database of handwritten digits. As a machine learning engineer, I will preprocess the dataset, build and train a neural network using PyTorch, and evaluate its performance. This project demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning for handwritten character recognition and showcases skills in data preprocessing, neural network design, and model evaluation.

Key Steps
Dataset Preprocessing:

Load and normalize the MNIST dataset.
Perform data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
Building the Neural Network:

Design and construct a neural network using PyTorch.
Training and Tuning:

Train the neural network on the MNIST dataset.
Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on a test set.
Analyze results to identify improvement areas.
Documentation:

Document the process in a Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations.
